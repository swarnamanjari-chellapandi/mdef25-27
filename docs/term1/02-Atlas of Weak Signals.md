# Atlas of Weak Signals

What I found fascinating about our first exercise with the atlas of weak signals, was the rootedness of the exercise. I have hunted sugnals for as far as I can remember, unconsciously. My blurting out of random trivia at dinner tables and conversations over coffee has earned me some weird stares and light hearted laughs. 

"Did you know that spinach could send emails?" my statement was answered with silence. 

Only here, was it observed with awe and surprise. Really? I would love to know more, said one of my classmates. Atop a cliff, overlooking the port of Barcelona, a heterotopia unto itself with moving goods.
