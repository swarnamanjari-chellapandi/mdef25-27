# Living with your own ideas

Prosthesis:

What is a prosthesis?

**An extension of your body.**

Does it enable, enhance or help you explore yourself and your environment?

How much of a prosthesis a need and how much of it is ornamnetation? Can jewellery be considered prosthesis? Can clothes be considered prosthesis?

How much is form and ow much is function? Can a social need count as a function? Such as the need to impress, create identity and express yourself in the social ladder.

These were some of the questions that we were asking ourselves before the three day workshop.

Soon after, our conversations, readings and lectures with some hands on making gave us whole different perspective on what a prosthesis can be.
