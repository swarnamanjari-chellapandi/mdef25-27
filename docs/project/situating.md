# Situated Design practices

To situate or not situate, that is the question. I have always heard stories of supercomputers, even seen one from a distance before. During my first visit, I was unaware of the implications of computing at large scales. After doing reserach about the history of computation and information technology, I am able to see the physicality of these systems in new light. Quite literally. Visiting the BSC opened up my view of seeing the ginormous systems behind computing. Layered shelves of GPUs behind clear glass, flickering servers, power supplies and humongous water cooling pipes were transparent. Yet, the 9 tennis courts of infrastructure were still hidden. The chimneys evaporating water vapour, other cables and the operators maintaining the functioning of it. While the supercomputer held my attention only for the spatial dimension of it, the quantum computer put me in awe of its ethereality. Housed in a chapel, this machine landscape was otherworldly. It imposed on me various visual metaphors about technology and religion; a parallel comparison I had always been curious about.
