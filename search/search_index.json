We also experimentaed with manual fabrication techniques like biomaterials and moulds. The shift between the digital and the physical was a good exercise for our brains to bring our ideas into their material realities. I learnt that something could make perfect sense as an idea but when it comes to prototyping is when limitations tend to rise. It is important to keep iterating with a clear vision to bring out the best possible outcome. In the course we played with shapes and forms. Some shapes were easier to cut with certain machines while some hard. For example the CNC was very good with organic shapes while laser cutting was good with sharo edges. Throughout, we had to be careful of the tolerances of each machine and material and account for our designs accordingly. I loved that the course allowed us to play with different materials and experiment with designing them through our ideas. The Kandinsky Cube \u00b6 For the primary mould design we took inspiration from the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky. We made sharp triangles and curved circles to chash with one another to create a geometry of symphony. We carried over the concept to each of the digital fabrication techniques and learnt on the way. Learnings \u00b6 Laser cutting as a proceswas familiar since they were 2d patterns. Learning the settings to print was essential. Safety precautions like turning on the air flow, the exhaust pipe for gases and keeping the material intact to the laser cutting surface were the key learning. During the 3d print process we had to generate and design a 3d model on rhino. Ensuring that the model had no intersecting surfaces was a huge challenge. Having a lot of small cubes in a geometry there were many intersecting lines and dead surfaces that we had to clean up. The magic word was Boolean Union between the surfaces as we were building. The cnc milling was more challenging to operate than design. We mistakenly pocketed the inside of the shapes than the outside. Thus the sharp corners of the triangle and aquare were not achieved. Experimenting with silicon moulds and biomaterials were enjoyable as we cooked some interesting recipes. Stirring well and keeping in mind the process time was key in both.

Does it enable, enhance or help you explore yourself and your environment? How much of a prosthesis is a need and how much of it is ormnamentation? Can jewellery be considered prosthesis? Can clothes be considered prosthesis? How much is form and how much is function ? Can a social need count as a function? Such as the need to impress, create identity and express yourself in the social ladder. These were some of the questions that we were asking ourselves before the three day workshop. Soon after, our conversations, readings and lectures with some hands-on-making gave us a whole different perspective on what a prosthesis could be. Day 1: To be the best version of myself \u00b6 Proto 1 For the first exercise, I started fitting objects at multiple parts of my body. I experimented with my ears, my knees, knuckles and elbows. I then went towards a quality of myself that I wanted to work on: clumsiness. I built joint protectors for my knuckles and toes. Knuckle protector: To use when I am chopping vegetables in the kitchen. Toes protector: To prevent myself from stubbing my toes all the time. Proto 2 I also made a built in wrist band which held my T- mobilitat metro card to scan at the gates. I face a very hard time removing the card from my wallet and wallet from my bag every time I travel by the metro. I tested it to see if it saved time, and it worked like magic! I was in and out of the gates in a few seconds! Image Grid Grid :material-image: :material-image: :material-image: Day 2: To become something else \u00b6 For the second exercise I experimented with movement. How could my movement aid my prosthesis? To become something else, I needed to erase my thoughts and my persona from the picture. One of the most common expressions of ourselves is through speech and the sounds we make. I decided to incorporate sound in my prosthesis so that it could make me listen more to my surroundings than speak. I mimicked the sounds of chirping crickets by dangling a few small bells from the edge of a string tied to a toothpick. The jingles sounded like insects in a forest. Day 3: The Double Game by Sophie Calle \u00b6 I, the detective? \u00b6 I was to be followed. It was an experiment. How would the person following me interpret my behaviour? How would I act with the knowledge that I\u2019m being followed? I turned around the experiment. I chose to let my detective into my personal space: a public park that I mostly go to free my thoughts when I have classes. I go there to sit under the trees and take a break. I sometimes sketch, and sometimes observe the dogs play. This time, I chose to write and tested if the detective was actively observing my observations while I was writing a personal narrative poem which invoked my emotions. It was a staged performance, where I, the artist, used the medium of my art to express what I was feeling; not through the art itself but through the process of making it. Beginning: I walk to the nearby park. I turn around to see if anyone is following me. I sense some movement but see no one. I continue walking and enter the park. I look to the right - my favourite spot is already taken. I move towards a bench that is well visible. This should be a good stage for my performance. (One mistake that I realised later was that I faced away from my detective. She couldn\u2019t see any of my expressions.) Middle: I start writing my poem. It\u2019s about yearning, loss and doubt. I repeat some sentences again and again. The poem is itself about performance. Performing for someone on social media, and I don\u2019t know if they are watching me or not. Initially I feel conscious about my detective watching me write. The words struggle to come out my text editor. As I take some time, I\u2019m used to being observed and I forget my surroundings. I get into my space of writing where I am alone with no one to disturb. I finish the last line. I almost tear up. End: I pack my bags and walk. My legs struggle to carry the weight of my thoughts. It takes some time for me to exit my writing space and come back to my surroundings. The walk helps a bit. I stare at the traffic lights. I wait for them to turn green. I take it slowly one step at a time. As I enter the university campus, I see someone running behind me. My detective attempts to click one last picture. Reflections \u00b6 I, cyborg Bodies: Cartoons and Cultural Deities I have grown up seeing daisies talk, octopuses help out, and butterflies cook. I have grown up seeing elephant gods being mischievous, monkey gods being loyal and parrot gods being intelligent. Seeing them never felt strange. It was easy to accept their identities, their actions and even feeling empathetic towards their personalities.\u201d I wish I could be like Daisy.\u201d \u201cOswald is too friendly, she should be a little less nice.\u201d \u201cButterfly is so sweet. I wish I had a friend like her.\u201d Listening to mythological stories with non-human characters and watching animated versions on screen made me feel a part of their world. In a world with lesser political correctness and identity warfare, representation was not fought for. We had to accept cockroaches as annoying yappers. However, when the characters moved towards the \u201chuman\u201d is when social biases started baking themselves into my understanding of the world. Transgender roles were often shown through a lens of violence. Women were shown through a lens of frailty and gay men were shown through a lens of shame. Let\u2019s not forget the roles that were never even allowed close to the screen. Our fetishization of human identities in recent times has broadened representation and allowed human beings of various skin colours, sexual orientations, class politics and religious leanings to inhabit the media screen trying to erase our existing biases around what a socially accepted human looks like. But, what about enlarging our existing boundaries? What makes a human, and what is more-than-human? Is there a non-human? The \u201cLiving with your Own Ideas\u201d class centered on the design of social and functional prosthesis made me question myself within the blurry lines between bodies and identities in a search for the more-than-human. I was trained in classical dance from a very young age. Going back to my understanding of the world when I was younger, the dance form taught me to embody various animal gods who would appear in the mythological texts. A snake, a fish, a turtle, and my most favourite: the elephant. The god Ganesha, has a human body and a giant elephant head that is highly disproportionate to his body. He makes up for it with his slightly squatted posture, a round belly and by riding on his pet mouse. When embodying, I used to flap around his huge elephant like ears, show his tusk and posture my hands to account for his round belly, all while squatting. I was asked to feel like an elephant and walk like one. Using my own limited organs, I had tried to expand the possibility of being more-than-human through movement. When we were given our first brief on designing a prosthesis on being a better version of ourselves, I was stuck. I started playing with materials, and placing them on different parts of my body. I covered my elbow, my fingers and toes. I tried to make a \u201cposture corrector\u201d. A device for protection. The materials and requirements to be a better version informed my design decision. I created from a place of fear, and incompleteness. I wanted to be less clumsy and more careful. I forget that I could be more, rather than trying to make myself \u201cjust enough\u201d or filling my faults. Movement: Limitations of materiality in technology After a conversation with Manuel de Aguas, the intentions became clearer. Prosthesis could be a tool for exploration and not merely enhancement. As with Thomas Thwaites, I could choose to be a \u201cgoat.\u201d Simply because I wanted to. If the objective was to be more than human, what were the tools? The physicality of embodying another life form meant expanding our bodily functions, having abilities that we would not possess otherwise. But, what about how they feel? How do bats echolocating and hunting for food at night react when they are lost? Do they panic or do they return home? Thomas Thwaites spoke to a shaman before deciding to be a goat. He earlier wanted to become an elephant. She said it would not be too easy to embody an elephant, something that lives far from Thomas\u2019 habitat. Also, elephants were highly emotionally intelligent animals. To embody them would mean impersonating their emotions, going into depressive episodes, mourn for the dead etc. Thomas wanted to take a break from being human. Elephants were too close to our human mental models. The shaman suggested he become something closer to him and easier to replicate. If we were to design exo-organs on a human to become a goat, we would have to reproduce the physical functions of one. In the process, Thomas built prosthesis for walking on four legs, a sac of rumen to digest grass and even a helmet to butt into other goats\u2019 heads. He even spent 3 days in the mountains wandering with a herd of goats. They invited him into their herd and locked horns. After 3 days, tired and exhausted, Thomas was left behind by the herd purely because of the physical limitations. I asked Thomas a question at the end of his presentation. After all the work on the prosthetics, adorning them and playing around with how they worked, did it make you feel more human than a goat? He said he was tired, exhausted and definitely wished he could sleep on a comfortable bed. I remembered my ways of embodying animals through movement and dance. Could a prosthesis limit our ability to transform to a replica of an existing organism? Could a prosthesis simply be a portal to exploring our own body to extents that it could never imagine itself in? \u2014 fin.","title":"Prototyping"},{"location":"project/prototyping/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"project/prototyping/#prosthesis","text":"What is a prosthesis?

I always envisioned a machine as its own entity, hiding how it functions, perhaps made to hide by the humans who designed it. Machines to me were black boxes concealing everything inside. Electricity was the magic that flowed through its veins, an idea that I grappled to understand. The switch was the command. When it didn\u2019t turn on, something was off inside, and I never imagined that I could \u201cfix\u201d it. To me \u201cunpacking machines\u201d was an exercise that went beyond what could be repaired and what was beyond repair. It helped me understand that machines are complex systems that go beyond their materialities. They encompass geopolitics, trade, supply chains, extraction, logic and sometimes, even a bit of mechanical magic. The information that was held behind the functioning of each part from a mechanical pump to a motherboard to a small voltage booster that we completely ignored until we realised a light wouldn\u2019t turn on if you just connect the positive and negative to a power source, was extensive. I also realised that the presence and absence of the documentation of this information was vital to understanding how the machine functioned. Power lies behind how information is obscured by high level technical jargon when in reality the way things work follows a simple logic. As we unpacked I couldn\u2019t help observing the projection of our human biology to connect different parts of the machine. The wires flowed like arteries and veins, distributing electricity while a controller like an arduino was leading the nervous system like a central command centre.The individual parts all had specific functions but when it came together performed a completely different function than imagined. Similarly, the same list of parts could be made into different machines altogether. Through concepts, narratives, aspirations, and our specific worldviews, the same few parts could be connected in different ways to imagine a myriad of machines.
